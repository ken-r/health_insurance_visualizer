# Health Insurance Visualizer
Health insurance premiums make up a significant portion of many people’s expenses. Every year, these premiums are adjusted, and switching insurance providers or plans can lead to considerable savings.
However, comparing premiums across different providers together with varying deductible (franchise) levels is often complex and confusing.

This tool (developed with Shiny and Python) simplifies this by enabling you to:

- Compare premium prices from multiple insurance providers side-by-side (similar to the official website [Priminfo](https://www.priminfo.admin.ch/de/praemien)
- Visualize how different deductible levels affect your total out-of-pocket costs (including premiums, deductibles, and the additional expenses that you need to cover).
